# CardPortfolioSite
A responsive website/template built on Skeleton, designed to either be a landing page or resume/portfolio of ones works.

## Disclaimer
This was made in order to further develop my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as my first foray into front end web development frameworks. Take it with a grain of salt if you wish to use this professionally.

## Tools used
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* SASS
* Skeleton
* unsplash.com

## Future for this project / Todo list
* Implement proper animations
  * Using AOS and Animate.css
* Possibly convert this over to Bootstrap (HUGE MAYBE)

## How to use
Just simply clone this repo or download it as a zip, make your changes and upload it on your own webserver or WordPress, or whatever your heart desires (I don't discriminate).

# Enjoy!
